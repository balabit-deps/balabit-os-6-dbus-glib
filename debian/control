Description: simple interprocess messaging system (GLib interface)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides development files for a deprecated GLib-based
 D-Bus library. New code should use GDBus, part of GLib, instead.
 .
 See the dbus description for more information about D-Bus in general.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (GLib-based shared library)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides a deprecated GLib-based shared library for
 applications using the GLib interface to D-Bus. New code should use
 GDBus, part of GLib, instead.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (GLib library debug symbols)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 This package provides support for debugging programs that use the
 deprecated GLib-based shared library.
